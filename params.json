A few examples of these features include:\r\n* A user system with two levels of permissions allowing for the creation and deletion of users, as well as the restriction of lower power users.\r\n* The creation, combining, or deleting of 'sources' (essentially data sets) which allows for easy categorization and sharing of large portions of data.\r\n* The ability to easily view the members of a given source as well as searching or filtering the members.\r\n* The ability to easily create, view (both in detail and summary), delete, or edit members of a given source in an instant.\r\n* Automatic calculation of the statistics of a given source.\r\n* The ability to export files in different formats, both locally or through email.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSeth Dixon - @Zeffe\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n* [wiki](https://github.com/Zeffe/Citadel/wiki)\r\n* zeffer5789@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
